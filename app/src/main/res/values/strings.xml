    <string name="covid19">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the virus strain "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2).[8] The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[9][10] Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are less common.[5][11] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms,[12] some progress to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure.[9][13] As of 20 March 2020, the rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is 4.1%, but ranges from 0.2% to 15% depending on age and other health problems.[7][14][15]

The infection is typically spread from one person to another via respiratory droplets produced during coughing and sneezing.[16][17] Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between 2 and 14 days, with an average of 5 days.[18][19] The standard method of diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia.[20][21]

Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining distance from others (social distancing), and keeping hands away from the face.[22] The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers, but not the general public.[23][24] There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.[25]

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak a pandemic[10] and a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).[26][27] Evidence of local transmission of the disease has been found in many countries across all six WHO regions.[28]</string>
